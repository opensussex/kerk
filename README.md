hhvm / hack minimal mvc

This is a very lightweight starting point mvc to be used with Hack.  This is purely code organisation / design pattern - the Model has currently been left as a blank class - so that you're able to do what you like with it.

There is a php version of this lightweight mvc - in the php_version branch.

###run the hvvm server
